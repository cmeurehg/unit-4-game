# unit-4-game

This web application was created as a simple, entertaining, adding game that is based on JavaScript and presented through the Bootstrap framework.

The game's theme is inspired by a treasure hunt... a treasure that turns out to belong to a group of pirates.  The app generates a random number that is supposed to be the number of coins contained in the treasure that you found.  The app provides four coin-set images with random number values.  By clicking on one coin-set or another, the user adds the corresponding number until it reaches the random number provided by the app.  If the number is exceeded, the user accumulates a loss.  If the number is matched, the user accumulates a win.
